# math_lib
Math library I'm coding as a way to get familiar with rust


This is for educational purposes do not use as it is not efficient nor safe.

I've implemented a Z/pZ and a Matrix struct and a few methods.
Right now I want to make a polynomial struct that you could evaluate on different rings.
later on I'd like to implement field extensions, elliptic curves, FFT and maybe a prime checking algorithm

Right now everything is in the main file wich is not great but idk the standard way to do things yet so i'll care about file structure later on.
