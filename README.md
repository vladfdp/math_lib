# math_lib
Math library I'm coding as a way to get familiar with rust


This is for educational purposes do not use as it is not efficient nor safe.

I've implemented a Z/pZ and a Matrix struct and a few methods.
Right now I want to make a polynomial struct that you could evaluate on different rings.
later on I'd like to implement field extensions, elliptic curves, FFT and maybe a prime checking algorithm

file structure is better but I'm still not exactly sure where to put certain things
